Introduction to object-oriented approach: 


Why object-oriented programming?
Characteristics of object oriented language: classes and objects - encapsulation-
data abstraction- inheritance - polymorphism - Merits and Demerits of object
oriented programming. UML- class diagram of OOP - Inline function – default
argument function- Exception handling(Standard) - reference: independent
reference – function returning reference – pass by reference



(2)


Classes and objects: 


Definition of classes – access specifier – class versus
structure – constructor – destructor – copy constructor and its importance – array
of objects – dynamic objects- friend function-friend class – container class


(3)


Polymorphism and Inheritance:


Polymorphism-compile time polymorphism – function overloading – operator
overloading - . Inheritance-types of inheritance- constructors and destructors in
inheritance – constraints of multiple inheritance-Abstract base class – pure virtual
functions- run time polymorphism-function overriding.



(4)


Exception handling and Templates


Exception handling(user-defined exception)- Function template , Class template –
Template with inheritance , STL – Container, Algorithm, Iterator -vector, list,
stack, map



(5)


IOstreams and Files


IOstreams, Manipulators- overloading Inserters(<<) and Extractors(>>)-Sequential
and Random files – writing and reading objects into/from files – binary files
