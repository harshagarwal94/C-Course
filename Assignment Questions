Take three words as input from the user. Arrange them in alphabetical order and display to the user.


Write a program that calculates the average time in seconds spent by the user on the homepage of VIT website.
This metric is called website traffic metric and is helpful in improving the effectiveness of the website. 
The user should be asked to enter time spent in seconds for the last 10 visitors and then display the average
time spent.


Create a UML Class Diagram for a class named Pizza. Data fields include a String for toppings (such as “olives”),
an integer for diameter in inches (such as 12), and a double for price (e.g. 13.99).
Include a method that displays the values for each of these fields.
Give reasoning for the access specifiers you choose for each member.


Create an Account class that a bank might use to represent customers’ bank accounts. 
Include a data member to represent the account balance. Provide a constructor that receives an initial balance
and uses it to initialize the data member. 
Provide three member functions. Member function credit should add an amount to the current balance. 
Member function debit should withdraw money from the Account and ensure that the debit amount does not exceed the Account’s balance. 
If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the function should print a message indicating
"Debit amount exceeded account balance." Member function getBalance should return the current balance. 
Create a program that creates an Account object and tests the member functions of class Account.


Create a class named Circle with fields named radius, circumference, and area.
Include a constructor that sets the radius to 1.
Also include a method named setRadius() to set the value of radius. 
Also create a calcDimensions() method to calculate the circumference and area of the circle. 
Create a display() method to display all the values to the user.
In the main() method create two Circle objects. Using the setRadius() method, 
assign one Circle object a radius value that is received from the user. For the second object, 
do not assign a value to the radius; instead, use the value assigned at construction.
Display all the values for the two Circle objects.


Leap Year Validation: Write a program that checks whether a particular year is a leap year or not. 
Prompt the user to enter a year to check whether it is a leap year. 
Please display appropriate messages to the user based on the result. 
(It is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4. However, if the year is evenly divisible by 100, 
then it is NOT a leap year, unless it is also evenly divisible by 400)
Test value - 2100 is not a leap year.
Note: Evenly divisible means when divided by a number, it does not leave any remainder.


You have to design an Account class. It should have three data members: user id(int), first name(string), 
last name(string) and account balance (double – protected field).
It should have a constructor that receives values for all the parameters and initializes them. 
It should have three member functions. Member function credit should take the amount to be credited as a 
parameter and return the modified account balance. Member function debit should take the amount to be debited 
as a parameter and return the modified account balance. Member function getBalance should return the current balance.
Create a UML class diagram for the same.


Illustrate, with the help of an example code, the process of using a default argument function.


A) Create a class named Painting that contains fields for a painting’s title, artist, 
medium (such as water color), price, and gallery commission. 
Create a constructor that initializes each field to the values sent as arguments except the gallery commission. 
Calculate the gallery commission as 20 percent of the price in the constructor. 
Create get member functions that return the fields for title, artist, medium, and price.
B) In the main function, prompt the user to enter the values for the painting’s title, artist, medium (such as water color), price.
Create an object of the Painting class and supply the user input.
